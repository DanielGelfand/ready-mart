# Dependencies: 
Runs with python3, flask, wheel, and passlib.
Python 3 and SQLite 3 are both required. SQLite 3 comes installed with python 3 so given you have python 3 installed, the program should work fine.

If you have not yet set up a virtual environment, refer to the **setup** section.
In your virtual environment, make sure to run the following:
```
$ pip3 install wheel

$ pip3 install flask

$ pip3 install passlib
```
