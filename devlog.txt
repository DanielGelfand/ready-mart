As a project manager, reading the part about teams being constructed of "crazy people" puts into perspective the type of issues that one may face when dealing with all sorts of people from all different backgrounds and of different skills. Having the bridge analogy made me realize that for my team, I have to be able to step up and make sure things go as smoothly as possible, our team already ran into one bump and I need to be prepared to face anymore to come. The part about the 1/0 as well, it highlights how misunderstandings of code can lead to unexpected changes that may break the code. It ties back into the idea of good code, where variables and function names should be clear and documented. 
ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY TEAM:
1)Use clear variable and function names so that the other team members can understand what is going on. On the same note include comments that explain your code as often as possible.
2)Do not forget to utilize the devlog. As a team we have to be able to work together and maintaining the devlog will improve our workflow since it tells the team what was accomplished/needs work.
